## Drug Repurposing using Knowledge Graph Embeddings ðŸ’Š
This repository relates to the paper **"Drug repurposing using knowledge graph embeddings with a focus on vector-borne diseases: a model comparison"**, as written by Diego LÃ³pez Yse and Diego Torres for the Conference on Cloud Computing, Big Data &amp; Emerging Topics 2023.

You can find here the data and code used for developing and evaluating the predictive models.

### Repository structure
- **datasets**: Contains the compound IDs and names used to map predictions against the model's ground truth.

- **models**: Contains the models used to perform the embeddings on the DRKG dataset.

- **KGE_system.py**: Outputs a drug ranking prediction based on chosen disease and embedding model

### Environment
The project was developed in the IDE Spyder 4 using Python 3.8.8
